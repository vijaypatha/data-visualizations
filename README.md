# Data Visualization with Python


## Abstract

Data visualizations are crucial for bridging the gap between data analysis and data consumption. This repository provides resources and examples to create impactful, customized visualizations using Python. It focuses on Matplotlib for static visualizations and introduces interactive visualizations using HoloViz.
